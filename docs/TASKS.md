# Tasks

Open tasks only, one block each (format in `pipeline/README.md`). A task that lands leaves this file in its records
commit, before its pull request merges (CI's scope gate finds the block in the branch's history): its REVIEWS line, its
ROADMAP row and the CHANGELOG line are the record. The planning thread writes blocks; the build thread
keeps `status` and `attempts` current.

The Esports plan (owner approved 2026-10-04; ROADMAP M36–M41, DECISIONS "M36–M41", the plan in the project's shared
files `research/esports-difficulty-2026-10-04.md`). Everything here is tagged dev with M35's content tag until the
owner says it's done. Any change to `src/ai/perception.ts` or BotWorld's sight is announced to the coordinator
first (M33 changes both).

## M36 · The Pro difficulty level
tier: core
perf: skip
touches: src/config/bots.ts, src/config/content.ts, src/pool/, pool.md, src/stats/, src/settings/storage.ts, src/ui/menus/, src/ui/recordsView.ts, src/config/menus.ts, src/config/matchRules.ts, src/matchSession.ts
acceptance:
  1. A fourth difficulty `pro` ("Pro") for opponents and teammates, tagged dev: listed only with the Dev content switch on.
  2. Its BOT_SKILL row: settled aim tighter than Hard, lead about 0.85, `aimErrorStartMetres` above zero, short bursts.
  3. Opponents roll kits as on Hard with partChance about 0.8; the Cyber Pistol rule applies as on Hard.
  4. pool.md's Difficulty table has a Pro row ×2, read by the game; a pool.md without the row still loads.
  5. Records keep `pro.<mode>` rows; saves from before load unchanged (no SAVE_FORMAT change, or an upgrade step if one is needed).

## M38 · Pro bots clear corners and play as a team
tier: core
perf: required
touches: src/ai/, src/config/bots.ts
acceptance:
  1. Near the enemy (a threat in mind, or walking its lane in the enemy's half), Pro bots walk instead of running the lane and slice corners: they aim at each corner ahead as it opens (M37's held angles, on the move), not where they walk. Hunting with nothing heard, they hurry.
  2. A Pro bot that hears a teammate call a hit goes for where the shot came from within a few seconds: to a spot nearby it can peek that way from when there is one, otherwise straight there at a run.
  3. Two Pro defenders sharing a lane hold its forward point together, the second in a crossfire on the choke where the map allows; Pro bots on one lane move in pairs (one sets off only while the other holds).
  4. A spot someone ducked out of stays watched (pre-aimed, at head height) for a few seconds before the bot goes after them. Bots share no more than the player's own screen would show: a teammate's hit call, heard by those near it, and nothing heard by someone else.
  5. Late in an Elimination round the Pro side behind on players pushes; Pro bots top up a low magazine from cover while a threat is in mind.
  6. Easy, Normal and Hard play as before (their guards unchanged).

## M39 · Rules picker: Skirmish, Tournament, Pro CQB, Custom
tier: core
perf: skip
touches: src/config/matchRules.ts, src/config/hits.ts, src/config/content.ts, src/sim/round.ts, src/sim/state.ts, src/matchSession.ts, src/game.ts, src/ui/menus/, src/config/menus.ts, src/ui/minimap.ts, src/ui/minimapView.ts, src/config/minimap.ts, src/pool/armory.ts, src/stats/, src/settings/storage.ts, src/config/replicas.ts
acceptance:
  1. A Rules row beside Mode; Skirmish (today's rules) is the default; Tournament, Pro CQB tagged dev; Custom holds every switch.
  2. Tournament: first to 7 with half-time and win-by-two overtime, 2:00 rounds, Elimination time-out won by the side with more players left (draw if equal), minimap teammates only, ricochets count, strict marshal (once the overshooting rule exists), Loadout locked for the match, own Armory kit.
  3. Pro CQB: Tournament plus semi-auto only and realcap 30-BB magazines (3 carried).
  4. Named rulesets get their own records on every difficulty and pay ×2 on Pro; Custom on Pro pays ×1.5 and never counts.
  5. The picker is the field rules presets' machinery: a new ruleset is one data entry.

## M40 · Map balance for Pro
tier: core
perf: skip
touches: src/ai/, src/map/, src/config/bots.ts
acceptance:
  1. Headless Pro guards per playable map: Attack / Defend attackers 40–60 %, each end 40–60 % of decided Elimination rounds, under 1 round in 10 on time.
  2. Depot unchanged unless its Office lane puts attackers under 40 %; then a window or second door between two rooms, layout tests still passing.
  3. Woodland and the city are checked against the same guards once their navigation lands.
  4. Held angles (M37) also cover stair tops on layered floors and bush edges and tree gaps where a map has foliage, tested on the maps that have them.

## M41 · What got you, Pro tips and tuning
tier: ui
perf: skip
touches: src/ui/, src/config/matchInfo.ts, src/sim/events.ts, src/game.ts, src/config/tutorial.ts, src/config/bots.ts
acceptance:
  1. After you're hit, a card shows where the shot came from, whether that bot was holding the angle, how long you were in view and whether you were moving.
  2. A setting turns it on for every difficulty; on by default only on Pro.
  3. Pro briefing tips (slice corners, short peeks, listen).
  4. Tuning numbers for Pro in one place, ready for the owner's playtest per map.
