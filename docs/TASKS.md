# Tasks

Open tasks only, one block each (format in `pipeline/README.md`). A task that lands leaves this file in its records
commit, before its pull request merges (CI's scope gate finds the block in the branch's history): its record
(`docs/records/<id>.md`) and its CHANGELOG line remain. The planning thread writes blocks; the build thread sets
`status` and `attempts` once, in its records commit (no status-only commits).

**The owner's 0.1 Dev 4 playtest notes (2026-10-06).** Recorded on his ask, not built yet; they follow the rest
of the paused 0.1 Dev 5 work. His words and the per-item reasoning are in the project's shared
files (`plans/playtest-feedback-0.1-dev-4.md`); `docs/ROADMAP.md` › Playtest notes: 0.1 Dev 4 maps all 26 notes. M80–M91
and M96 are 0.1 Dev 5 fixes and changes, M92–M95 suggested 0.1 Dev 6 features. Notes 5, 20–23 went to 0.3 and 0.4; notes 5, 20, 22 and 23 are now
0.1 Dev 6 (owner's feature picks, 2026-10-06, with Dev 7 folded into Dev 6 the same night; ROADMAP).
Every block below carries note 19: tune on Normal, then check that Easy, Hard and Pro still scale. `touches` are
first guesses; the build thread confirms them before it starts. The owner ruled on every conflict on 2026-10-06
(ROADMAP, under the playtest table).

**The owner's playtest notes on main (2026-10-07).** Recorded on his ask, not built yet. His words, the type and the
defaults per note are in the project's shared files (`plans/playtest-feedback-2026-10-07.md`);
`docs/ROADMAP.md` › Playtest notes: main after G3 maps all eight. M97–M99 join the Dev 4 notes batch (Dev 5 item 6); M100 is the graphics work's (Dev 5
item 5, with the G4 HUD restyle); note 3 was a bug, fixed in BP2; note 2 is already in the game
(Settings › Controls › Aim button). Note 19 of the Dev 4 notes still applies.

**0.1 Dev 6 (confirmed with the roadmap, 2026-10-06).** M92–M95, the holster and the practice
upgrades, come before the 26 features in `docs/ROADMAP.md` › 0.1 Dev 6, whose blocks are written when that build starts.

## M92 · Holster and two kinds of sprint (playtest note 3)
tier: core
perf: skip
touches: src/sim/armament.ts, src/sim/movement.ts, src/sim/commands.ts, src/sim/aiming.ts, src/input/keyBindings.ts, src/config/controls.ts, src/config/movement.ts, src/render/handPoses.ts
contract: PlayerCommand (a holster slot, by addition)
acceptance:
  1. Key 3 holsters (1 primary, 2 secondary), rebindable.
  2. Sprinting holstered is a little faster than sprinting with a replica; drawing to aim from holstered takes longer (with a draw animation) than raising from a ready sprint.
  3. Bots use the same rules through the same commands.

## M93 · Practice: moving targets, new target types, a timed challenge (playtest note 10)
tier: core
perf: skip
touches: src/sim/rangeTargets.ts, src/render/rangeTargetsRenderer.ts, src/map/range.ts, src/rangeSession.ts, src/config/range.ts, src/ui/rangeReadout.ts
contract: none
acceptance:
  1. Moving targets and more target kinds (for example small, pop-up and swinging).
  2. A timed challenge, off by default: hit as many targets as you can in a set time; the best score is kept.
status: open
attempts: 0

## M94 · Practice on any map (playtest note 11)
tier: core
perf: required
touches: src/rangeSession.ts, src/map/, src/sim/rangeTargets.ts, src/ui/menus/
contract: none
acceptance:
  1. The practice range is renamed "Practice"; it offers the range and every playable map (Dev maps with Dev content on).
  2. On a map, targets (M93's kinds) stand where bots would play, and there are no bots.
status: open
attempts: 0

## M95 · Practice with any unlocked replica (playtest note 12)
tier: ui
perf: skip
touches: src/rangeSession.ts, src/ui/menus/loadoutScreen.ts, src/ui/loadoutChoice.ts, src/config/dev.ts
contract: none
acceptance:
  1. In Practice the player picks any replica they own and can Customise it freely.
  2. With Dev settings on (Unlock all gear), every replica and part is available.
status: open
attempts: 0

## IM1 · The main game file under its size limit (improvement 4, the owner's OK 2026-10-12)
tier: ui
perf: required
touches: src/core/onDemand.ts, src/core/README.md, src/game.ts, src/ui/menus/menus.ts, src/ui/menus/lazyScreens.ts, src/ui/menus/armoryScreen.ts, src/ui/menus/summaryScreen.ts, src/ui/menus/README.md, src/ui/menus/css/, src/ui/runStatus.ts, src/ui/recordsView.ts, src/config/loading.ts, src/config/menus.ts, src/config/chunkBudget.ts, vite.config.ts
contract: none
acceptance:
  1. The rarely opened screens (the Loadout with Customise, the Armory, Settings) and the practice range with the tutorial are fetched the first time they are needed, not at start-up, so the start-up game chunk sits below the build's warning line (90 % of its budget), all of the start-up code counted in it; the budget is 1,250 kB (owner, 2026-10-12: room for Dev 6), with a DECISIONS line.
  2. The menus stay smooth (owner, 2026-10-12): that code is fetched in the background once the title is up, so opening a screen shows no pause; opened before it has arrived, the screen on show stays until it does (no flash), a later choice wins, and a failed download says so and is tried again on the next open.
  3. Entering the range or the tutorial may wait for its code with the start of play (owner: a loading screen is fine there); a failed download leaves the menus up with a message.
