# Tasks

Open tasks only, one block each (format in `pipeline/README.md`). A task that lands leaves this file in its records
commit, before its pull request merges (CI's scope gate finds the block in the branch's history): its REVIEWS line, its
ROADMAP row and the CHANGELOG line are the record. The planning thread writes blocks; the build thread
keeps `status` and `attempts` current.

The Esports plan (owner approved 2026-10-04; ROADMAP M36–M41, DECISIONS "M36–M41", the plan in the project's shared
files `research/esports-difficulty-2026-10-04.md`). Everything here is tagged dev with M35's content tag until the
owner says it's done. Any change to `src/ai/perception.ts` or BotWorld's sight is announced to the coordinator
first (M33 changes both).

## M40 · Map balance for Pro
tier: core
perf: skip
touches: src/ai/, src/map/, src/config/bots.ts
acceptance:
  1. Headless Pro guards per playable map: Attack / Defend attackers 40–60 %, each end 40–60 % of decided Elimination rounds, under 1 round in 10 on time.
  2. Depot unchanged unless its Office lane puts attackers under 40 %; then a window or second door between two rooms, layout tests still passing.
  3. Woodland and the city are checked against the same guards once their navigation lands.
  4. Held angles (M37) also cover stair tops on layered floors and bush edges and tree gaps where a map has foliage, tested on the maps that have them.

## M41 · What got you, Pro tips and tuning
tier: ui
perf: skip
touches: src/ui/, src/config/matchInfo.ts, src/sim/events.ts, src/game.ts, src/config/tutorial.ts, src/config/bots.ts
acceptance:
  1. After you're hit, a card shows where the shot came from, whether that bot was holding the angle, how long you were in view and whether you were moving.
  2. A setting turns it on for every difficulty; on by default only on Pro.
  3. Pro briefing tips (slice corners, short peeks, listen).
  4. Tuning numbers for Pro in one place, ready for the owner's playtest per map.
